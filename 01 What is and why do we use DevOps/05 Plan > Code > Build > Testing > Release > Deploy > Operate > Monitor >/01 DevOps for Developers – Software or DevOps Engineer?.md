if you tossing up between these to different options
- Software engineer
- DevOps engineer
this video **help you make the decision**.

expample:
problem
- one we're ceating an algorithm to keep uses engaged with our application
- the other we're creating a system that scales our application serviers and resources.
‚¨ÜÔ∏è similarities between these this problems
- both writing code to slove.
- both relying heavily on metrics to understand when and where the problem is occurring. 

ü§î **Software** enigeer problem
- using metrics from what the user is clicking on.
- what they're commenting on
- pulling data from what their other interests are thay you have
- how many posts have they clicked on?
- how many of the have hey liked?
- how many have they commented on? 
ü§î **DevOps** enigeer problem
- the number of users online?
- the API reponse time?
- CPU utilization
- memory uitlization
- network throughput

**the real distinction** between those two prolems is who your customer is almost
- software engineering problem: the customer is actual human useing your app.
- devops  engineering problem: the custormer is application infrastructure.

one more example
software engineer problem: visual layout.
devops engineer problem: which parts of that can be improved fro performance. 

**A DevOps engineer really is a software engineer anyway** 
Cos DevOps just write infrastucure code instead of user-facing application code.
So, **you can always switch** If you decide that one might be better for you.

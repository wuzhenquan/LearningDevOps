you will learn what tools you need to learn.

DevOps is link between the two⬆️

DevOps need to understand concepts of Software ⬇️
- How developer work
- Which Git Workflow
- How application is configured
- Automated Testing

![[Pasted image 20220814225414.png]]

### Skill - Operating System & Linux Basics
 be responsible for preparing the infrastructure to run the application 

- Linux Basics 
- comfortable using CLI
- Shell Commands 
- Linux FiIe System
- Server Management
- SSH Key Management 

### Skill - Networking & Security
- FireWall, Proxy Servers
- Load Balancers 
- HTTP/HTTPS
- IP, DNS Name Resoulution

### Skill - Containers
- understand concepts of vitualization 
- understand concepts onf containers
- manage containerized application on a server

### Skill - CI / CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)
When we think
	🤔 how to get these features and bug fixed from development to the servers to make it available to the end users?
	🤔 how do we release the new application versions basically? 
🚖 The main tasks and responsibilities of DevOps comes in. 
	DevOps 🤔: How I do this continuously  in an efficient & fast & automated way

## build Automation & CI/CD
DevOps must configure complete CI/CD Pipline

 为什么这是一个「无限」的图形？
	 因为 application imporvement 是无限的
	 因为new features and bug fixes 一直在持续进行的

### Cloud Proivders
why I need to learn at least 1 cloud provider
 - save costs
 - offer a range of services ( ) to make you easier to manage your infrasturcture
	 - load balancing | backup | clustering | sercurity
	 - with UI to create network configure firewall, router tables 
for aws as example
	it's pretty complex, but you don't need to learn all.
	you just need to know thow concepts and services that you need to deploy and run your specific application on the aws infrasturcture.

### Container Orchestration
why? 
	for small applications, docker compose or docer swarm is enough to manage.
	for a lot more containers (e.g. big microservices), we need more powerful container orchestartion tool (e.g kubernetes)  
- skill: learn Kubernetes ☸️

### Monitoring
problem
🤔 how do you track perfomance of you individual applications
🤔 whether everything runs successfully 
🤔 whether your infrastructure has any problems
🤔 how do you know in real time if your users are experiencing any problems
jobs
- set up monitoring for your running application
	- underlying kubernetes cluster
	- the servier on which the cluster is running

### Infrastructure as Code
 creating and maintaining the infrastructure for one environment already takes a lot times and is very error prone.
 ⬆️ we want to automate it as much as possible.
 how? use code to: 
	 - create infrastructure
	 - configure to run and deploy your app

### Scripting Language
- small applications to automate tasks like doing backups 
- system monitoring tasks
- cron jobs
- network management

### Version Control
GIT

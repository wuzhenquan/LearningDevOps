Automation
- speed of deployment
- stability of networking infrastructure
- consistent improvement
## Networking The Basics

## Switches vs Routers

**Routing** is the process of moving data **between** networks.

-   A router is a device whose primary purpose is Routing.

**Switching** is the process of moving data **within** networks.

-   A Switch is a device whose primary purpose is switching.

This is very much a foundational overview of devices as we know there are many different Network Devices such as:

-   Access Points
-   Firewalls
-   Load Balancers
-   Layer 3 Switches
-   IDS / IPS
-   Proxies
-   Virtual Switches
-   Virtual Routers

Although all of these devices are going to perform Routing and/or Switching.

Over the next few days, we are going to get to know a little more about this list.

-   OSI Model
-   Network Protocols
-   DNS (Domain Name System)
-   NAT
-   DHCP
-   Subnets

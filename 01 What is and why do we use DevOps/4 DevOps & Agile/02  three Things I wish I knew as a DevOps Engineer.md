# AVOID BEING TOO BIASED

# THE FUNDAMENTS
learn about the underlying fundamentals of a technology rather than how to use the technology and how to apply the technology

take docker as an example: 
❌ just learning how to run a container doing that the docker run command
✅ dive into the **linux kernel feature** that make containerization work
why? when we talk about Linux kernel features in order to learn yourself containerization, you'll now have a fundamental understading about how docker works and then if you take these Linux kernel features that you learn to step further you can actually apply the same concepts and really easily learn how kubernetes use this features to make kubernetes is what it is. so this is just an example using docker in kubernetes as an example of **studying the fundamentals  of a technology** because now what you do is actually fast-track your learning even further because when you learn about Linux features tha make up kubernetes, you start learning about net working, load balancing, BPF, ivy table, proxies.

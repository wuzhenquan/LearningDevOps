[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yWAtQ6wYNM&t=318s) - Challenges DevOps tries to solve 
 ⬇️ ⏰ slow down the release process
- miscommunciation and lack of collaboration between developers and operation
-  conflict of interest
	- developers focus on releasing new features as fase  as possible without thinking so much about stability.
	- operation focus on maintain the system stability and resist new change being pushing out 
- security
- Application Testing
-  manual work
	- Manually deploying app
	- Manually preparing the deployment environment
	- Manually configuring Jenkins build jobs
	- Manually configuring user access & permissions  
DevOps tries to 
	-remove all these roadblocks and things that slowdown the release process, and 
	- instead of manual inefficient process.
	- create 'Full Automated & Streamlined Processes'  for release cycles

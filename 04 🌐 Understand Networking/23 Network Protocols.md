📽️ [Network Protocols - ARP, FTP, SMTP, HTTP, SSL, TLS, HTTPS, DNS, DHCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5bSumTAHZE&list=PLIFyRwBY_4bRLmKfP1KnZA6rZbRHtxmXi&index=12)
Internet Standard ➡️  [RFC 826](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc826)

Protocols
- ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
- FTP - File Transfer Protocol
- SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
- SSL - Secure Sockets Layer | TLS - Transport Layer Security
- HTTPS - HTTP secured with SSL/TLS
- DNS - Domain Name System
- DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

each host requires these 4 things
- IP Address
- Subnet Mask
	- you can think of this as postcode or zip code.
- Default Gateway
	- You could think of this as the single road that allows us out of our street.
	- providing us with that Layer 3 connectivity.
- DNS

> if you have 1000 or 10,000 hosts then that is going to take you a very long time to determine each one of these individually. This is where DHCP comes in and allows you to determine a scope for your network and then this protocol will distribute to all available hosts in your network.

>  When you connected to the coffee shop WiFi your machine would have picked up a DHCP address either from a dedicated DHCP server or most likely from the router also handling DHCP.
